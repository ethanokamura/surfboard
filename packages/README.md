## Data Structure

Scalability: Sharded subcollections help manage large lists and ensure that you stay within Firestoreâ€™s document size limits.

Efficiency: Using composite keys and arrays allows for efficient querying and data retrieval.

Simplified Data Management: Keeping separate collections for likes and saves ensures that data is not duplicated and is easy to manage.

Composite Indexes: Implemented composite indexes in place for efficient querying.

Pagination: Implemented pagination to handle data efficiently on the client side.
